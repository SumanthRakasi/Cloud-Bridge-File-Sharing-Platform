# Project Setup and Run Instructions

This guide will help you set up your Python environment, install the necessary dependencies from requirements.txt, and run your Streamlit app.

## 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo


## 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies.

### Using venv (Python 3.6+):

#### On macOS and Linux:
bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


#### On Windows:
bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate


## 3. Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install the required packages using the requirements.txt file:
bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt


## 4. Run the Streamlit App

After installing the dependencies, run the Streamlit app by executing:
bash
streamlit run app.py

This command will start the Streamlit server and open your default web browser to display the app.

## 5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When you are done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:
bash
deactivate
